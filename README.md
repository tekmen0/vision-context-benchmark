# Vision Context Benchmark

Aim :
In this repo, I will seek the answer to the question :
```
  Do deep and other computer vision models check for context in the images?
```

The context here means the pixels that do not represent the object of interest, which is object we want to detect.

I generated context dataset for checking if your model is able to control context in the image. That's why i named repo as benchmark.
